"""
Abstract base class for `Bra` and `Ket` states.

The state vector class stores the coefficients of an abstract state
in respect to a certain basis. These coefficients are stored in the
`data` field and the basis is defined in the `basis`
field.

"""
Abstract base class for all operators.

All deriving operator classes have to define the fields
`basis_l` and `basis_r` defining the left and right side bases.

For fast time evolution also at least the function
`mul!(result::Ket,op::AbstractOperator,x::Ket,alpha,beta)` should be
implemented. Many other generic multiplication functions can be defined in
terms of this function and are provided automatically.

"""
Base class for all super operator classes.

Super operators are bijective mappings from operators given in one specific
basis to operators, possibly given in respect to another, different basis.
To embed super operators in an algebraic framework they are defined with a
left hand basis `basis_l` and a right hand basis `basis_r` where each of
them again consists of a left and right hand basis.
